This is the readme for the model published in 

Kampa & Stuart (2006) Calcium spikes in basal dendrites of layer 5
pyramidal neurons during action potential bursts. 
J Neurosci 26(28):7424-32.

The simulation creates two plots showing voltage and calcium changes
in basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons during action
potential (AP) backpropagation.  Running after selecting 1 AP leads
to (after zooming in on the Ca2+ plot):

Usage:

Autolaunch from ModelDB **or** download and extract the archive and
then compile the mod files in the mod directory and run under ...

linux/unix
----------
by typing
nrnivmodl mod
in the top level directory.  Then type
nrngui mosinit.hoc

mswin
-------

by running mknrndll, cd'ing to the mod directory and press make
nrnmech.dll button.  Copy the nrnmech.dll file to the parent directory
of the mod folder (the top-level directory).  Double click on the
mosinit.hoc file.

MAC OS X
--------

drag and drop the mod folder onto mknrndll icon in the NEURON
application folder.  Start a terminal window, cd to the directory
within the expanded archive and type 
mod/powerpc/special mosinit.hoc -
to start the simulation.

-------

Choose the number of APs in a burst and press the run button. By
increasing the number of APs the calcium signal in the basal dendrites
will increase supralinearly.  3 or more APs in a burst will lead to
generation of a dendritic calcium spike similar to the experimental
results shown in Kampa & Stuart (2006).

In addition, a 4-AP experiment, blocking IA channels, can be simulated
or a TTX experiment blocking local Na channels.
